## Gmail Configuration

 Some configuration is needed for google's security purposes. If those settings are not set up, this code will not work.

To allow the access, we need to set 'Less Secure App Access' settings in the google account. If the two step verification is on, we cannot use the less secure access.

To complete this setup, follow the steps below:

1. Login into you google account and click on "*Account*"
